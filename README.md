- Outstanding balance > 50% of the original loan amount.
- More than 2 missed repayments.
- Loan tenure exceeds 12 months.


**DATESET - TABLE**
-- Drop tables if they already exist
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Repayments;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Loans;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Customers;

-- Create Customers table
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name VARCHAR(255)
);

-- Create Loans table
CREATE TABLE Loans (
    loan_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    loan_amount DECIMAL(15,2),
    loan_term_months INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id)
);

-- Create Repayments table
CREATE TABLE Repayments (
    repayment_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    loan_id INT,
    repayment_date DATE,
    amount_paid DECIMAL(15,2),
    payment_status VARCHAR(20) CHECK (payment_status IN ('On Time', 'Missed')),
    FOREIGN KEY (loan_id) REFERENCES Loans(loan_id)
);

INSERT INTO Customers (customer_id, customer_name) VALUES
(1, 'Alice'),
(2, 'Bob'),
(3, 'Charlie');

INSERT INTO Loans (loan_id, customer_id, loan_amount, loan_term_months) VALUES
(101, 1, 10000.00, 24),
(102, 2, 15000.00, 36),

INSERT INTO Repayments (repayment_id, loan_id, repayment_date, amount_paid, payment_status) VALUES
(1, 101, '2024-01-10', 2000.00, 'On Time'),
